## Overview

CAMEL-Bench is a **Comprehensive Arabic LMM Benchmark** designed to evaluate and improve the capabilities of **Large Multimodal Models (LMMs)** in the Arabic language. Our benchmark aims to bridge the gap in multimodal model evaluation for Arabic, which represents a large population of over 400 million speakers worldwide.

The benchmark includes **eight diverse domains** and **38 sub-domains** to rigorously assess the performance of LMMs in visual reasoning and understanding tasks. It comprises over **29K questions**, curated by native Arabic speakers, ensuring high-quality evaluation.

## Key Features

- **Eight Domains of Evaluation:** Multimodal Understanding and Reasoning, OCR and Document Understanding, Chart and Diagram Understanding, Video Understanding, Cultural-Specific Understanding, Medical Imaging, Agricultural Image Understanding, and Remote Sensing Understanding.
- **Over 29,000 Questions:** Carefully curated by native Arabic speakers to ensure quality and accuracy.
- **Broad Scope:** Evaluates models in domains such as **medical imaging**, **cultural-specific understanding**, and **remote sensing**.
- **Open and Closed Source Evaluation:** We provide a leaderboard featuring results from both closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source LMMs.

## ðŸ“¢ Latest Updates
